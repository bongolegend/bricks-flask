<h1>Bricks - Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>SECURITY</h2>
Access to your account is restricted by the use of Google Sign-In, a third-party authentication system in which you use your google account to authenticate your Bricks account.
Bricks does not have access to the login credentials you use for your google account.
Bricks only records your google ID, as a way to match your Bricks account with the Google Sign-In process.


<h2>DATA</h2>
By using the Bricks app, you agree to the following data policy:
<h4>Data Collection</h4>
Bricks collects personal identification: your google account ID, your username, your email address.
Bricks collects app usage data, i.e. when you log in.
Bricks collects the tasks and grades that you submit through the platform.
Bricks collects the actions you take on the platform, such as “liking” or commenting on a task, including other people’s tasks.
<h4>Data Storage</h4>
Bricks stores the above data in a database that Bricks manages internally. No third party has access to or makes use of this database.
If you have friends on the platform, or are part of a team, your team members will be able to access the tasks and the grades that you submit. They can access this data through their own account on the Bricks platform. This data gets temporarily stored on their device (e.g. their iPhone).
<h4>Data Analytics</h4>
Bricks is the only party that conducts analytics on user data.
Analyses may include understanding how users use the platform, and understanding the content that users submit, in an effort to better design the platform to suit the users’ needs.

This policy is provisional and will be updated as the Bricks platform changes.
